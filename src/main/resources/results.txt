notes: im a little off. all values after 3 are smaller than they should be, and get smaller as N gets bigger. 8 is off by like 20k
im clearly off because cubes exist that are differnt but have all the same metrics i have found so far
also, im way off becaues these numbers are close the "translation" numbers which dont take rotation into account. i need numbers close to the 3-d rotation column
